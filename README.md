# ML_BASICS_Logistic_Regression_with_Python

This is a neat way of taking the linear equation we used in the Linear Regression tutorial and manipulating it to deal with non-linear problems such as Binary Classification.

The important differences between linear and logistic regression:

1) Linear function vs. Sigmoid function
2) Dependent variables: Continuous vs. Categorical predictive targets
3) Cost function: Least Squares vs. Cross Entropy
